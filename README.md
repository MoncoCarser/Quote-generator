# Quote-generator
JavaScript Quote-generator exercise project.

Quotes are received through an API
	-API data is stored in GitHub to avoid issues if API goes out of use
	-Could also store the data in a JS file, but that is beyond needs of this exercise project
Web page then shows one quote at a time with a name, or unkown if no name is known. 
	-If loading takes long, user will see a loading animation.
User can press right side button to see a new quote, or left side button to share the quote in Twitter.
Web page uses DOM manipulation to do tasks when user presses a button.
